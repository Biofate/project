BioFate is the webpage of the project BIO-fate, which aims to develop machine learning models to better assess the bioaccumulation in aquatic environment, thereby reducing animal testing.

### Our mission
* Improve the bioaccumulation assessment at the regulatory level
* Leverage machine-learning methods without losing the connection with mechanistic insights
* Reduce animal testing
